# Looker-studio-Dashboards-

These looker studio dashboards are just a few exmaples of the kind of visualisation i have completed for various team projects. 

The Supermarket analysis using the "Demand Analysis Tool" is a creation of mine, whereby i have manipulated a google Ads API to run analysis on hundreds of keywords across hundreds of locations across the UK within Python. I have then blended this with other datasets in order to increase its value. This tool allows clients and internal teams to analyse the Search volume for various keywords across over 985 locations across the UK, innovating the way we use Search volume data from a marketing perspective. 

The WoW tripadvisor dashboard is a project, whereby we have used webscrpaing techniques to gather thousands of reivews across hundreds of restaurants. 

The REORG dashboard is was created to have oversight of visitors to over 50 gyms across the UK. Here, i deployed 50 physical QR codes across all of the gyms. I then implemented an app scripts behind google forms, to extract user location, cross referencing this with gym location. i have also extracted other useful information using the timestamp, such as day of the week, time of the day ect. This system is completely automated, and has given incredible visibility for customer experience and success of each gym.
